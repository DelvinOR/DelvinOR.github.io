Welcome to my portfolio website!

This is a website dedicated to showcasing my github projects on a custom design website.

My name is Delvin Ortiz. I am a recent graduate from Rutgers University with a bachelor of science degree in computer science. As an entry-level developer, I aspire to obtain a position in software engineering or application development. I focus on improving my app development skills by building projects that can be commercialized.
